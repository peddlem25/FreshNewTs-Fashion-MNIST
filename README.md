#What is Fashion-MNIST?

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. "If it doesn't work on MNIST, it won't work at all", they said. "Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."

## What are GANs?
[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) (GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A *generator* ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a *discriminator* ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.

During training, the *generator* progressively becomes better at creating images that look real, while the *discriminator* becomes better at telling them apart. The process reaches equilibrium when the *discriminator* can no longer distinguish real images from fakes.

This notebook demonstrates this process on the FASHION-MNIST dataset and created 10 new articles of clothing.
